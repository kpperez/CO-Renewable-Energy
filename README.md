# Colorado Renewable Energy Proposal
## Objective 
The primary objective was to propose strategically positioned hydroelectric dam locations to the Colorado Secretary of State for future consideration. This analysis identified consumption and emission patterns along Colorado's western slope. Hydroelectric dam candidates were based on proximity to populated areas, historical precipitation, volume of water, existing structures, and various other factors. 
## Technologies
- Data Mining, Cleaning, & Analysis: Excel
- Visualizations & Dashboard: Tableau
- Presentation: PowerPoint
## Project Architecture 
![CO_Hydro_Arch](https://github.com/kpperez/CO-Renewable-Energy/assets/123265217/7a40d240-5396-401d-a0c4-5daf21b0786e)
## Steps
1. Data was scrapped and sourced from various websites including the [Colorado Information Marketplace](https://data.colorado.gov/).
2. Cleaning and manipulation were done using [Excel](https://github.com/kpperez/CO-Renewable-Energy/tree/main/Data).
3. Next was visualization and dashboard creation using Tableau, view the dashboard [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/CO_Hydro_WB/hem_dashboard?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
4. Research paper was presented via PowerPoint [presentation](https://github.com/kpperez/CO-Renewable-Energy/blob/main/Renewable_Energy_Presentation.pptx) to the Colorado Secretary of State.
## Questions
All questions are specifically for Colorado's Western Slope.
1. What areas consume the most energy?
2. What are the emissions from renewable energy vs non-renewable?
3. How much energy is produced and consumed for renewable energy vs non-renewable?
4. Are there active dams that can be converted to hydroelectric dams?
5. Where are areas along rivers for new hydroelectric dams?
6. Which cities have the most precipitation? 
## Summary of Findings 
- The counties along the Colorado River consume the most energy (Mesa, Garfield, Eagle).
- The emissions are much higher for non-renewables than renewable energy 1000M tons of C0<sub>2<sub/> vs 10M.
- Much more energy is produced by fossil fuel than renewable energy 1000k MWh vs 10k.
- The Western Slope produces significantly more energy than it consumes, and the economy is tied heavily to fossil fuels.
- There are over 100 active dams that are quality candidates for being converted to Hydroelectric.
- The Colorado River has many areas that are suitable for new Hydroelectric dams.
- Cities with the most precipitation are Climax, Aspen, and Steamboat Springs. 
## Limitations 
- Many of the online sources with data require payment for information.
